Twitter is currently the go-to place where developers hang out. Because of this, any developer tool startup needs to have a solid Twitter presence to meet customers where they are. And let's face it ‚Äì most developer tool startups _don't_ do a good job at Twitter.

Here is a practical guide on how to consistently grow your startup's Twitter account, establish yourself as a market leader in a niche, and attract developers to your product. These strategies are based on growing my 36,000 followers Twitter followers and more than doubling the growth of Fig's Twitter account, from 2,000 to over 4,500 followers in 7 weeks.

## Purpose

The first thing you should consider are what your objectives are by growing your company presence on Twitter. It‚Äôs going to be an investment in terms of time & money so it‚Äôs important to clarify this. Here are some examples:

- Establish Akita as a market leader in the Observability space
- Attract more software engineers to grow beta user base and hire talented engineers

## Metrics

Progress can be measured through:

- Twitter followers
- Engagement % per tweet
- Impressions per tweet
- Number of replies on tweets
- Number of people tweeting at Akita

## Brand

You need to think about the personality of your brand to make sure there‚Äôs a consistent voice in tweets. Here are some questions you can answer.

- What words do you want people to associate with Akita?
- Do you want the tweets to be very professional or a little more edgy/playful?
- Is there a style guide for tweets?

## Scope

Another important topic to think about is the scope of the account. Do you want to only tweets from the company account or will you be using the account to respond to support questions?

Do you want to interject yourself in conversations around a specific topic? For example, you can set up searches for ‚Äúapi observability‚Äù and respond to relevant convos. This can also extend to other platforms like Reddit and Hackernews.

üí° Tools like [F5bot](https://f5bot.com/) can be used to monitor your brand or specific keywords on hackernews and reddit.

# 5 Types of Tweets

Now that we‚Äôve went over why you want to grow on Twitter, how you can measure it, and defining the scope, let‚Äôs talk about what kind of tweets you need to grow.

Broadly speaking, you can classify tweets from a company account into 5 categories: jokes, information, company updates, questions, and asks. Let‚Äôs dive into each one and how often you should be using it.

### 1. Funny Tweets

Funny tweets are memes that relate to some sort of developer struggle. The Supabase team does a good job at doing these memes, focused on databases since that‚Äôs their focus area.

I helped do this at Fig as well, with memes focusing on the terminal.

### 2. Informative tips and tricks

These are just any useful tips and tricks that make you go, ‚ÄúWOW, I wish I knew that 2 years ago‚Äù. These can be informative fun (like the one below) or informative useful. This helps establish yourself as an expert in a certain category if you‚Äôre constantly pushing out high quality tips and advice for a niche.

### 3. Company Updates

Announcing new features or company updates is great because it gives a sense of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre always shipping‚Äù to others and allows new users to find your product. Railway does a nice weekly change log for this and Fig typically announces new features through 10-15 second screencasts since we found that those do well.

### 4. Questions

Questions can be teasers for new features, like the one to the left, or questions for interesting discussions like the one to the right. They usually don‚Äôt do great but can sometimes go viral because Twitter loves to promote Tweets that get a lot of replies, especially in quick succession. May the algorithm be with you.

### 5. Asks

These are Tweets where you‚Äôre asking something of your audience. To check out your blog, jobs page, a podcast you were on, give you their email, ect... You should keep these tweets to a minimum. Ideally, you want to give (entertainment with funny tweets & useful information) many times then ask once.

# Tweeting Strategy

You should think about the different types of tweets and come up with a cadence that works well for you. A sample one could be:

We‚Äôre going to post 5 tweets a week. These will be:

- 0% questions
- 40% Informative tips (1-2 useful observability tweets per week)
- 20% asks (Share 1 piece of content per week)
- 20% memes (1 meme per week)
- 20% company updates (1 changelog per week)

<aside>
  üí° Schedule your tweets each week with a tool like [TypeFully](https://typefully.com/). You can
  pick the time where you typically get the most engagement and you don‚Äôt have to remember to post
  each day.

## Partnerships

Partnering with developer influencers is can also be a good idea. We had an angel investor at Fig with ~60k twitter followers that liked our tweets and occasionally retweeted. Making your angel investors aware of your Twitter account (and then only posting quality content) will get them to interact with it more and more.

I‚Äôve seen some companies even get developer influencers as ‚Äúadvisors‚Äù in their company where I think they just put them on the cap table so the influencers are incentivized to spread the word since they‚Äôre invested in the success of the company

You can also partner just for promotions like giveaways or paying for engagement. Thirdweb did this for their launch tweet to the right, where they paid devs to quote Tweet at a specific time.

## Extra Things that may help

- Always text-only is boring. Mix in images, GIFs, and screencasts where you can. Especially if you make a visual update (like adding something new to the dashboard). Look for excuses to show off how great your product looks.
- Ask people to follow you on Twitter when helping users 1:1 and in email drip campaigns after users have signed up
  - The reality is you need to drive more and more people to Twitter to grow exponentially. In addition to your tweets getting shared and growing organically, if you can funnel in even more followers from outside of Twitter from your blog, content, and emails, that‚Äôs great.
- You can do a monthly Twitter brainstorming session each month where whoever wants to from the team can show up to brainstorm tweet ideas. You can then rank them and use them for the next few weeks
- Achievement tweets are great. We‚Äôve reached 1000 users! We‚Äôve reached 2000 Github stars. We‚Äôre reached 500 email newsletter subscribers! Whatever it is, it‚Äôs a good excuse to send it since it leads even more people to check it out.
