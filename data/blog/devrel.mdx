You might have seen Developer Relations (also referred to as DevRel or Developer Advocacy) around Twitter lately and been confused on what it was. Or maybe you have a fuzzy understand of DevRel and you want to learn more about it to try to get a job in it.

Either way, this blog post is for you. We're going to be tlaking about what developer relations is, exploring its 3 main areas, then talking about how to land a job in this field.

## The 3 Pillars of DevRel

Before we discuss the pillars of DevRel, let's give a quick overview of what it is. DevRel is a role that exists at developer tool companies (companies whose target market is developers), meant to increase awareness of a specific product or technology. It's a way to both raise awareness of a product or technology, and to collect feedback from the developer community to relay it over to engineering.

I like to think of DevRel as having 3 main categories: Community, Content, and Product. Some Devrels do one of these while others are focused on a couple; it ultimately depends on people's skillsets and what the company needs. Both as a startup hiring for devrel and as someone who wants to get into it, it's important to understand these areas to know which you want to focus on. Let's explore each one in more depth.

### Community

Community-focused DevRel usually centers around growing and managing a community of developers. This is typically a Slack or Discord community that's focused on a product or technology. Managing a community consists of greeting new members, answering questions, designing the community in an inclusive way, and making sure your members are getting value from the community. This can also include livestreams, events, and other activities that help the community grow.

### Content

Content-focused DevRel is straightforward; spreading the word through written and spoken content. This can involve writing blog posts, making videos, teaching workshops, recording podcasts, and more.

### Product

Product-focused DevRel is about owning the developer exeprience of the product. In other words, it's about improving how it feels to use a specific product or technology. This can be done by talking to users to understand how they're using it, then making improvements to the documentation and creating guides based on their answers.

This can also extend to the product ecosystem so working on code examples, templates, and integrations is also common.

## Getting Involved

This is a relatively new role. To stand out though, you should try to have 2 out of 3 of these.
In my experience, startups that hire developer advocates want to know that you have at least 2 of these:

1. You can code. I usually just talk about and show off some side projects for this one
2. You have experience with building communities. I show off that I built a large gaming community with a startup I did in college, am involved in the react reddit community, &amp; did 6 weeks of devrel at a company focused on docs &amp; growing their discord
3. You have experience with content creation. I show off my talks, YT videos, tweets, and blog posts for this one

As long as you can demonstrate that, some of them will probably want to move forward. I suggest having a website or writing up a document showing you can do those 3 things then reaching out to the startups I mentioned
