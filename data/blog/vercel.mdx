I'm a Developer Advocate at Vercel, where I primarily focus on community.

## Meetups

I ran Vercel's first ever in-person meetups this year! Learned a lot about the importance of connecting with the community face to face.

I also started a Next.js job board that got several developers hired: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/40172

- Create invite list for Next.js Conf

### July

- Next.js Conf Registration site
- Next.js Conf planning and ideas with the team
- 4 customer stories

### August

- Reddit Improvements - revamped our homepage with a description, tags, flairs to organize questions, and helped with SEO
- Next.js Conf CFP - Put out a call for papers, defined what kind of talks we were looking for, and reached out to 50+ individuals to personally invite them to apply to ensure we had great and diverse speakers (attach that tweet)
- Next.js Conf - invited the majority of folks and oversaw invites for the whole conference with many stakeholders (partnerships, press, engineering, CEO, community, sales)

### September

- Next.js Conf – registration pages for NYC and London (duplicated registration pages for SF so we could invite folks to our NYC and London watch parties). Worked with the London team and sales folks to manage invites, send emails, and define copy
- Next.js Conf - dashboard to visualize invites (we had a lot of trouble tracking invites on Google sheets so I developed a custom dashboard to track all invites with people’s pictures, category (press, partner, community, VIP, ect…), and context about them
  - I also extended this to visualize waitlists so we knew what people we wanted to invite to achieve our goals for Next.js Conf
- Next.js Conf - planned VIP Dinner for speakers and VIPs (attach Michelle’s tweet)
- Next.js Conf - planned After Party (”best night of my life” from many people). Arcade games were a huge hit.

### October

- Ran speaker comms, selected speakers for CFP, & worked with speakers to submit great talks
  - Talks are the main part of any conference and I was in charge of them and ensuring they were good
- Decided the schedule for Next.js Conf
  - Since I was familiar with speakers and talks, I came up with a schedule that strategically placed the best talks, ads from our sponsors, and our own vercel content in a way that flowed nicely
- Next.js Conf - invite codes for G
  - G wanted to invite some VIPs but the way our invite only system worked was that they had to give us their email and receive an invite there. I built custom functionality for G to be able to send one time use invites to folks, and he got people like the creator of JS to attend because of it
- Next.js Conf - check-in system
  - We needed a system to check folks in as they arrived, on laptops and cell phones, so I built one
- Salesforce commerce cloud template w/ Michael. Pain, pure pain
- Ran the entire Next.js Conf virtual conference. Coordinated live with SF Jazz where the conference was held, was in charge of our platform that 50k individuals turned in to, and was switching between talks, our live feed, and more while pushing social media updates and platform highlights
- Ran Discord for Next.js Conf, included sponsored channels, moderating, ect…
  - This was our live chat for the whole conference, I managed a team of Vercelians to run it and moderate it

### November

- Vacation
- Make Next.js Discord more sustainable (hired two part time mods to take care of the discord so we can focus on other things)
- Next.js Conf Image Gallery site (include post from G and kudos)

### December
