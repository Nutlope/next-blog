I'm a full-stack software engineer based in Philadelphia. I founded [UltraShock Gaming](https://twitter.com/ushockgaming), a game marketing startup with a community of 500,000 members on Steam, and ran it for 4 years before [selling it](https://www.hassanelmghari.com/blog/startup-journey). I'm passionate about startups in the developer tools space and building interesting side projects.

Some recent projects I've done include:

- Creating & patenting a [medical device for DVT prevention](https://dvtpd.com/)
- Building a [machine learning classifier](https://github.com/Nutlope/covid-classifier) for predicting covid
- Building a [search engine](https://abdaal-search.web.app/) for my favorite YouTuber
- Contributing to [open source projects](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete)

I graduated with a B.S in computer engineering from Drexel and am currently working as a developer advocate for TBA. When I'm not coding, I'm playing soccer, reading, writing or enjoying some good food with friends.
