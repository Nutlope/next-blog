I'm a software engineer specializing in full-stack web development and dabbling in machine learning. I founded [UltraShock Gaming](https://twitter.com/ushockgaming), a game marketing startup with a community of 500,000 members on Steam, and ran it for 5 years before selling it. I'm passionate about startups, specifically in consumer products and developer tools.

I graduated with a B.S in computer engineering from Drexel and am currently working as a developer advocate. When I'm not coding, I'm probably playing soccer, reading, writing for my blog or enjoying some good food with friends.
